    Overview

This is a lightweight command-line image classification tool that automatically organizes images into six worksite-related categories:

    civil

    electric

    hvac

    garden

    cleaning

    mech

It uses a pretrained EfficientNet-B0 model fine-tuned for these six classes. When you run the script, it will:

    Load the model from disk

    Predict the label of each image in the current directory

    Copy the image into a subfolder named after the predicted class (e.g., =classified/civil/=)

Original images are not modified.

    Directory Structure

#+BEGIN_SRC
.
├── classify_and_copy_images.py # Main script
├── models/

    Setup

    Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
conda create -n daily_classifier python=3.9 -y
conda activate daily_classifier
#+END_SRC

    Install dependencies:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
pip install torch torchvision pillow tqdm
#+END_SRC

    Usage

    Place =classify_and_copy_images.py= in the folder containing the images you want to classify.

    Ensure the =models/best_model.pth= file is in place.

    From the terminal, run:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
python classify_and_copy_images.py
#+END_SRC

After it finishes, all classified images will be copied into =classified/{label}/= folders.

    Model

    Architecture: EfficientNet-B0 (via torchvision)

    Format: PyTorch state_dict

    Trained on labeled worksite data for six categories

If you want to train your own model for this structure, refer to the notebook in =nbs/basic training.ipynb= (if available).

    Notes

    Images are not deleted or moved, only copied

    Folder structure will be created automatically

    Supports JPG, JPEG, PNG
